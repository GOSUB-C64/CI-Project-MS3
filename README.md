# Context

'World Of Bread' was an idea I came up with because of my background as a chef and the love of the art of making fantastic loaves of bread with such simple ingredients as flour and water and just the sheer pleasure of eating it.

# UX

## Summary

The website was designed with simplicity at heart.
Any user can come to the site and 'add' to the growing database of breads.

A user can:
+ enter their own bread recipe
+ take a recipe they want from the collection.
+ edit other users' recipes to shape the community's experience.
+ not delete any recipes.


## Design
Colours chosen to reflect simplicity.


# User Stories

## Ideas to assist in developing MS3 project.
(overall goal - I want the site to grow) 

+ user story 1

    On accessing the site the user should be able to see a welcome image which is related to the overall purpose of the website.

+ user story 2

    As a user (who is interested in what this site is all about) I'd expect to see a short description of the reason for the site's existence and what the user can achieve during their visit.

+ user story 3

    As a contributing user, I'd like to ADD to the website by inputting information so it is grouped with the rest.

+ user story 4

    As a returning visitor I'd like to see my recently added information.

+ user story 5

    As a contributing user, I'd like to have the ability to edit/update my recently added contribution.

+ user story 6

    As a contributing user, I'd like the power to delete my recently added information if I've changed my mind.

+ user story 7

     As a returning user - I'd like the ability to search through all the available information using certain search criteria; for example... search all records on the world encyclopedia website for information on 'forests' - it should list ALL forests.

+ user story 8

    As any user to the site - I must not be able to change/remove any other records on file that do not belong to me.

+ user story 9

    As a first time user - I should be able to register with the site and then log in.

+ user story 10

    As a returning user I should have the ability to 'login' and/or 'logout' with confirmation on screen

+ user story 11

    As any user I should be able to easily navigate to what I want to do next, easily.

+ user story 12

    As a contributing user after adding to the site there should be a thankyou message thanking the user for their contribution.
